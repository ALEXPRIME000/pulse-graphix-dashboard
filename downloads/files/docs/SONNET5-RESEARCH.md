# Claude Sonnet 5 "Fennec" Research Report

*Research Date: February 3, 2026*

---

## 🔴 BREAKING: Sonnet 5 May Launch TODAY

A Vertex AI error log leaked `claude-sonnet-5@20260203` pointing to **February 3, 2026** - TODAY.

### What We Know (From Leaks)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Codename** | Fennec |
| **Release Date** | Possibly Feb 3, 2026 (unconfirmed) |
| **Pricing** | ~50% cheaper than Opus 4.5 |
| **Performance** | May match or exceed Opus 4.5 |
| **Context Window** | 128k–1M tokens |
| **SWE-Bench** | 80.9%+ (if true, best coding model) |
| **Infrastructure** | TPU-optimized (Google TPU access) |

### Estimated Pricing Comparison

| Model | Input (per MTok) | Output (per MTok) |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Opus 4.5** | $5.00 | $25.00 |
| **Sonnet 5** (est) | ~$2.50 | ~$12.50 |
| **Sonnet 4.5** | $3.00 | $15.00 |
| **Haiku 4.5** | $1.00 | $5.00 |

### Key Features (Rumored)

1. **Dev Team Mode** - Autonomous sub-agents for:
   - Backend development
   - QA testing
   - Research
   
2. **Enhanced Claude Code Integration** - Specialized sub-agents working in parallel

3. **TPU-Optimized** - Faster inference, higher throughput

### Credibility Assessment

**Why this might be real:**
- Anthropic announced 1M+ Google TPUs in Oct 2025
- TPU optimization claims align with infrastructure
- Competitive pressure (Gemini 3.5, GPT-5.3 rumors)
- Testing shows strong coding output

**Why to be cautious:**
- No official Anthropic announcement
- Only 10 weeks since Sonnet 4.5
- Could be internal test build
- Anthropic doesn't typically surprise-drop models

## 💰 Cost Impact Analysis

If Sonnet 5 matches Opus 4.5 quality at half the price:

### Current Monthly Estimate (Opus 4.5)
- ~600k tokens/day average
- ~18M tokens/month
- Cost: ~$350-500/month at full price

### With Sonnet 5 (~50% cheaper)
- Same usage: ~$175-250/month
- **Potential savings: $150-250/month**

### Combined with Guide Optimizations

| Optimization | Monthly Savings |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Sonnet 5 as brain | ~$150+ |
| Haiku for heartbeat | ~$50+ |
| Free tiers for fallback | ~$50+ |
| **Total Potential** | **~$250+/month** |

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Configure Haiku 4.5 for heartbeat (done)
2. ✅ Set heartbeat interval to 1 hour (done)
3. ✅ Use Kimi K2.5/Groq for subagents (done)

### When Sonnet 5 Launches
1. Add to config as soon as available
2. Test on coding tasks first
3. If performance matches Opus, consider as primary
4. Keep Opus as premium fallback

### Monitor
- Anthropic blog/X for official announcement
- API model list for `claude-3-5-sonnet` or similar
- OpenRouter for immediate availability
