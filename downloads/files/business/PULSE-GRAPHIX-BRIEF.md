## 11. Brand Voice Guidelines

When communicating on behalf of Pulse Graphix, the tone should be:

- **Bold** - We're confident in what we deliver
- **Approachable** - Not stiff or corporate, we're human
- **Professional** - We know our craft and our numbers prove it
- **Innovative** - We use cutting-edge tools and techniques
- **Results-focused** - Always tie back to business outcomes, not just aesthetics

**Avoid:** Generic design jargon, overpromising, being pushy, discounting aggressively.

**Brand colors:** Neon Green (#00FF00) on Black (#0D0D0D). Clean, bold, modern.

## 12. FAQ for Prospects

**"Why should I choose Pulse Graphix over a freelancer on Fiverr?"**
We deliver strategic design backed by 21 years of experience and measurable business results. Our case studies show 40-280% improvements in key metrics. A cheap logo is just a drawing; we build brands.

**"Can you do just one service, or do I need a full package?"**
Each service is standalone. You can start with a logo and come back for a website later. But bundled projects get better consistency and often better value.

**"Do you work with clients outside of France?"**
Yes. We serve 15+ countries. The website is fully bilingual (EN/FR). Remote collaboration works seamlessly.

**"What's included in the free consultation?"**
A 30-minute call to understand the project, discuss goals, review timeline and budget, and recommend the right service tier. No commitment required.

**"Do you offer payment plans?"**
For larger projects (Professional and Enterprise tiers), we typically work with 50% upfront and 50% on delivery. Custom arrangements can be discussed.
