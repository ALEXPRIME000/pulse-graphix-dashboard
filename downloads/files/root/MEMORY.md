## 🎨 DESIGN PREFERENCES (CRITICAL — Feb 16, 2026)

**⚠️ Kabundji is a graphic designer. World-class visual quality is MANDATORY:**

- **Style:** Rich, colorful, visually stunning — never bland or utilitarian
- **Inspiration Sources:** Pinterest, Dribbble, Behance best-in-class designs
- **Aesthetic:** Glass-morphism, bold typography, vibrant accents, professional polish
- **Expectation:** Everything must look like it came from a top-tier design studio
- **UNACCEPTABLE:** Default Bootstrap/Tailwind, uninspired layouts, "developer aesthetic"
- **Reference Points:** Premium SaaS dashboards, editorial design, Swiss typography
- **Colors:** Neon accents on dark backgrounds, sophisticated palettes
- **Mood:** Confident, premium, memorable, award-worthy
