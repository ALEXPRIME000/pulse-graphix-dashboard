## Part 3: Humanization Techniques

### Why AI Content Gets Detected
1. Repetitive sentence patterns
2. Overly formal language
3. Lack of personal anecdotes
4. Predictable word choice
5. No natural "noise" (ums, asides)

### Humanization Techniques

**1. Add Personal Stories**
- Start chapters with personal experience
- Include specific details (dates, places, names)
- Share failures, not just wins

**2. Vary Sentence Structure**
- Mix short and long sentences
- Use fragments.
- Start sentences with "And" or "But"
- Break rules intentionally.

**3. Include Imperfections**
- Add typos then fix them
- Include colloquialisms
- Use contractions (we're, don't, can't)
- Write like you speak

**4. Add Deep Research**
- Quote real people
- Cite specific sources
- Include statistics with dates
- Reference current events

**5. Edit for Voice**
- Read aloud, mark awkward phrases
- Replace generic words: "good" → "solid," "killer," "surprisingly decent"
- Add transitional phrases: "Look," "Here's the thing," "Honestly"

**6. Use AI Detection Tools**
- Check with: GPTZero, Originality.ai, Copyleaks
- Rewrite flagged sections
- Aim under 30% AI probability
