- **Web & mobile development** — from WordPress sites to Flutter and React apps
- **3D visualization** — architectural rendering and immersive presentations
- **AI agents** — custom solutions that handle complex tasks autonomously

I'd love to learn more about what [Company Name] is working on and see if there's a way I can help.

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email — I know things get busy, and messages slip through.

To recap briefly: I'm a Paris-based tech consultant specializing in AI automation, web/mobile development, and 3D visualization. With 21+ years in the industry, I've helped businesses of all sizes modernize their workflows and build products that scale.

If now isn't the right time, no worries at all — I'd just appreciate a quick reply so I know whether to circle back later or leave you in peace.

And if you'd prefer, I'm happy to share a few case studies or examples relevant to [their industry/company type] so you can see the kind of work I do.

Either way, thanks for your time.

Best,

Kabundji

## 3. Service-Specific Pitch (Automation Focus)

**Subject lines (pick one):**
- What if you could automate [specific task]?
- Saving [Industry] teams 20+ hours/week with AI workflows
- The manual work your team shouldn't be doing

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend on [repetitive task relevant to their business — data entry, report generation, lead qualification, invoice processing, etc.]?

I ask because I've been helping businesses automate exactly those workflows — and the results are dramatic. One client cut their weekly admin time from 15 hours to under 2.

Here's what I do:

**AI Automation & n8n Workflows**
I build custom automation pipelines that connect your existing tools (CRMs, databases, email, spreadsheets) and handle repetitive tasks without human intervention. Think: automatic data syncing, smart notifications, report generation, and more.

**AI Agents**
For more complex needs, I create AI agents that can reason, make decisions, and take action — not just follow scripts. These handle customer inquiries, process documents, manage inventory triggers, and more.

I've been doing this for over 21 years, and I'm based in Paris — which means I'm available for both remote collaboration and in-person meetings across Europe.

Would a 20-minute call make sense to explore what automation could look like for [Company Name]? I can walk you through a few examples and give you an honest assessment of what's feasible.

Let me know what works for you.

Best regards,
