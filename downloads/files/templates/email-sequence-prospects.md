## Email 1: The Warm Introduction (Day 0 - After Initial Contact)

**Subject:** Following up on your website needs, {{company_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today about {{company_name}}'s digital presence.

I know we covered a lot of ground quickly, so I wanted to send you a quick summary of what Pulse Graphix can do for you:

**What you mentioned wanting:**
- {{prospect_need_1}}
- {{prospect_need_2}}
- {{prospect_need_3}}

**Our approach:**
We build websites and digital assets that actually convert visitors into customers — not just pretty pages. For businesses like yours in {{industry}}, that typically means {{specific_solution}}.

**Next step:**
I'd love to put together a custom proposal based on what we discussed. I can have something ready within 48 hours that outlines exactly what we'd build, how long it would take, and what it would cost — no surprises.

Would that be helpful?

Best,
Chicco Mutombo Kabundji

## Email 2: The Value Drop (Day 3 - If No Response)

**Subject:** Quick question: {{first_name}}, are you still prioritizing website improvements?

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to follow up on our conversation from earlier this week.

No pressure if the timing isn't right — I know running {{company_name}} keeps you busy. But I did want to share something that might change your perspective on the investment:

**What most business owners don't realize:**
Every day without an optimized website, you're likely losing {{estimated_leads}} potential customers to competitors with better digital presence. Based on your traffic and conversion rates, that's approximately ${{estimated_revenue_loss}} per month in unrealized revenue.

**The flip side:**
We recently helped {{case_study_company}}, a similar {{industry}} business, increase their inquiries by {{percentage_increase}}% after redesigning their site and improving their booking flow. Their investment paid for itself in {{payback_period}} months.

I don't know if those numbers resonate with where you are right now, and that's okay. But if you're curious about what that could look like for {{company_name}}, happy to run the numbers.

Either way — thanks for considering us.

Chicco

## Email 3: The Clear CTA / Final Attempt (Day 7 - Final Follow-up)

**Subject:** Last note: Your website project

{{first_name}},

I'll keep this short since this is my third email and I don't want to clutter your inbox.

Quick question: **Is a new website still something you're seriously considering this quarter?**

Three possible answers:

**A) Yes, we're interested — send me that proposal**
→ Just hit reply with "PROPOSAL" and I'll prioritize you this week

**B) Interested, but timing/price isn't right**
→ Reply with "LATER" and I'll circle back in {{delay_months}} months with updated options

**C) Not a priority right now**
→ Reply with "N/A" and I'll stop following up (no hard feelings)

Either way, I appreciate you considering Pulse Graphix. Whether we work together or not, I genuinely hope your digital presence serves your business well.

Wishing you success,
Chicco

P.S. — If you know anyone else in the {{industry}} space who could use our services, I'd appreciate the referral.

## Email 4: The Win-Back (Day 30 - For Old Leads)
## (Bonus: Re-engagement Campaign)

**Subject:** {{first_name}}, something new for {{industry}} businesses

Hi {{first_name}},

We spoke a few weeks ago about your website, and I know it wasn't the right time.

Since then, we've launched something you might find interesting:

**[INSERT NEW SERVICE/OFFER]**
- {{new_offer_benefit_1}}
- {{new_offer_benefit_2}}
- {{new_offer_benefit_3}}

Worth a 10-minute conversation?

If not, no worries — I won't keep this thread open forever.

Chicco
