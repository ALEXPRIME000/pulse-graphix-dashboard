# Cold Call Script v1 — Pulse Graphix
*For calls Feb 24-25, 2026 | 4 Qualified Leads*

---

## 🎯 Opening (15 seconds — CRITICAL!)

**SCRIPT:**
```
"Hi, this is Chicco from Pulse Graphix. I know this is a cold call — 
I'll be brief. I was passing by your {business type} and noticed something 
quick. Do you have 30 seconds?"
```

**IF ASKED "WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?":**
```
"I'm a designer who helps {business type}s in {area} attract more customers 
with better branding. I noticed {specific observation} — can I share a quick 
thought?"
```

---

## 🔍 Observation Hook (Pre-Call Intel)

### Le Belvédère (Restaurant)
```
"Your Google listing shows beautiful food photos, but I noticed your website 
isn't loading on mobile — and that's where 70% of restaurant searches happen."
```

### C.C.P Fournil (Boulangerie)
```
"Your pastries look incredible on Instagram, but I couldn't find you on Google 
Maps with current hours — you're missing rush-hour traffic."
```

---

## 💬 Value Pitch (30 seconds)

**IF THEY SAY YES:**
```
"Here's what I do: I create logos, menus, and websites that make people 
stop scrolling and start ordering. 

For example, I recently helped a {similar business} in {area} get {result} 
in {timeframe} with a {deliverable}.

Quick question — are you currently working with anyone on your 
{website/branding/online presence}?"
```

---

## ❓ Common Objections & Responses

### "No budget right now"
```
"I get it — budgets are tight. Here's the thing: I work with businesses 
at different stages. 

Even a €500 logo refresh can increase walk-ins by 20%. 
Worth a 10-minute chat to see if there's a fit?"
```

### "I'm already working with someone"
```
"Great! That means you value good design. 

Quick question — are you happy with how quickly they turn things around? 
I specialize in 48-hour turnarounds for urgent needs."
```

### "Send me an email"
```
"Absolutely, I will. But real talk — I send 50 emails a day. 
The ones that get responses? The people I've spoken to. 

Can we book 15 minutes this week before I send anything?"
```

### "I don't need marketing"
```
"Fair enough. Out of curiosity — how are people finding you right now? 
Walk-bys? Word of mouth?

[Let them answer]

Got it. So if I could help you get just 10 more customers a week 
without you doing extra work — would that be interesting?"
```

---

## 🏁 Close — The Two Options

**ALWAYS END WITH TWO OPTIONS:**

```
"I'm talking to a few businesses this week. I have:

Option A: A free 15-minute audit — I'll review your current branding and 
tell you the #1 thing I'd change.

Option B: A proposal call — where I present 3 options tailored to you.

Which feels less annoying?"
```

**BOOK THE CALL:**
```
"Great. I'm free [Day] at [Time] or [Day] at [Time] — which works?"
```
