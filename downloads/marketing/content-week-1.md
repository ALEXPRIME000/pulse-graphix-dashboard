### Post 1: Thought Leadership (Monday)
**Hook:** "95% of business websites are leaking money."

**Body:**
Here's what 20 years in tech has taught me:

Your website isn't a brochure.
It's a 24/7 salesperson.

Yet most businesses treat it like an expense instead of an investment.

3 signs your website is costing you customers:

1️⃣ Loads slower than 3 seconds = 53% of mobile visitors bounce
2️⃣ No clear CTA = visitors don't know what to do
3️⃣ No social proof = visitors don't trust you

Fix these 3 things and watch your inquiry rate climb.

Or keep wondering why competitors book more calls.

Your move.

After: Clean custom design, optimized photos, perfect mobile experience

**Result:** Client went from 2 inquiries/month to 12.

Lesson: Design isn't decoration. Design is revenue.

### Post 4: Personal Story (Sunday)
**Hook:** "I almost quit after my first client."

**Body:**
2004. First freelance gig.

Client wanted a website. Simple enough.

3 weeks of work. Countless revisions. Sleepless nights.

Delivery day: "This isn't what I wanted." Refused payment.

I was devastated. Questioning everything.

Then my mentor said something that changed everything:

"You didn't fail. You learned what questions to ask next time."

I went back. Asked better questions. Understood the vision.

Redesigned it. Client paid. Referred 3 friends.

20 years later: lesson still applies.

The client isn't the enemy. Clarity is the solution.

### Post 1: Educational (Thursday)
**Headline:** "Why Your Website Isn't Converting (And How to Fix It)"

**Body:**
You've spent money on ads. You have traffic.
But the phone isn't ringing.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: your website is the problem.

5 conversion killers:

1. Confusing navigation — Visitors can't find what they need
2. No clear value proposition — They don't know why to choose you
3. Weak calls-to-action — "Contact us" isn't compelling
4. Missing trust signals — No reviews, testimonials, or proof
5. Poor mobile experience — 60%+ of your traffic is mobile

The fix? Audit your site against these 5 points. Be brutal.

Your website should work harder than you do.
